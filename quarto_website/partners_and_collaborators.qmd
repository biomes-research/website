### Our partners

As an **independent, nonprofit association**, BIOMES is committed to advancing research that benefits public health and scientific understanding. We collaborate with international research groups and scientists who share our dedication to innovative research for public good. While we maintain strong connections with academic professionals, we remain independent and our work is driven by our **nonprofit mission**.

Our key collaborators include:

-   [**Yilmaz Lab**](https://www.dbmr.unibe.ch/research/research_programs/yilmaz_lab/index_eng.html): Led by Bahtiyar Yilmaz, a leading microbiota researcher, this collaboration focuses on fundamental research in human gut microbiota. Though based at the University of Bern, our partnership is rooted in a shared commitment to advancing science beyond institutional boundaries.

-   **Misselwitz Lab**: Headed by Benjamin Misselwitz, a renowned expert in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Ludwig Maximilian University. This collaboration supports our mission to develop new insights and solutions in the field of gastrointestinal research.

At BIOMES, we value these partnerships for their contribution to our **mission**.
